This is documentation of our group's mascots Peanut, Hunch, Honey, Butter, Tom and Jerry. These are rescue animals cared for by group members and we hope they will have happy lives!      

Peanut
------

She is about one and half years old, has a black coat, and is a bit skittish. She loves peanuts (though this isn't the reason for her name) and cashews.

Hunch
-----

He's about one and half years old, has a black and speckled grey coat. He's friendly and loves to explore though requires extra care due to dental problems.

Honey & Butter
--------------

Sisters from the same litter, they both have tan coats and a extremely curious and friendly.

Tom & Jerry
-----------

Brothers of Honey and Butter, they're a bit shy, but somehow almost twice as large as their sisters. It must be those walnuts they love..
